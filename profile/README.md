This is the public mirror of repositories by the [Electronic Vision(s) Group](http://www.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/vision/) at the [European Institute for Neuromorphic Computing](https://www.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/einc/)/Kirchhoff-Institute for Physics, Heidelberg University, Germany.

This organization hosts software, hardware and tools related to the neuromorphic systems we developed:
* Spikey
* BrainScaleS-1 — wafer-scale accelerated neuromorphic hardware
* BrainScaleS-2 — hybrid neuromorphic hardware
