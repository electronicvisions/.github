# Electronic Vision(s)

This is the public mirror of repositories by the Electronic Vision(s) Group at the Kirchhoff-Institute for Physics, Heidelberg University, Germany (http://www.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/vision/).

This organization hosts many repostories related to the neuromorphic systems we developed:
* Spikey
* BrainScaleS-1 — wafer-scale accelerated neuromorphic hardware
* BrainScaleS-2 — hybrid neuromorphic hardware
